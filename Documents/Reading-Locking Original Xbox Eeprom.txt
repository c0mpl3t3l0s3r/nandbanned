Reading hard drive key from Original Xbox Eeprom
--------------------------------------------------

Was going through some electronics and found my old Xbox. Went to power on
the seemed like it wasnt  recieving any power. The power/eject board had a few burnt traces i soldered 
a few wires and the console turned on! I was suprised it started well sort of.. I didnt have the original 
drive for the console so no HDD key. I found a few things on reading the eeprom info with an Arduino/Raspberry Pi.
Had luck with DuinoBoX and after a few tries i finally got a full eeprom backup. The backup worked out and was able to revive
the console with the HDD key and an ide hard drive.

Made a little guide for locking/cloning hardrives - eeprom reading

Hardware needed:
==============================
Stock Xbox without its hard drive/eeprom
Xbox able to run homebrew (ChimpLoader) via soft/hardmod*
Arduino & usb Type-B Cable(I used an arduino uno seemed to work)
Jumper wires to connect the Arduino and the Xbox
Pc running windows Xp-10 (Tested on Windows 10)
Molex power adapter

Locking capable ide hard drive
look here: https://xboxdrives.x-pec.com/?p=list for compatible drives
(sata drives can work with ide to sata adapter & 80wire ide cable) 

Software Needed:
===========================

Arduino IDE

LiveInfo by Yoshihiro:
--------------------------
An eeprom editing and creation tool for the original Xbox
https://legacy.downloads.diomtec.com/homebrew/xbins/PC%20Based%20Applications/eeprom%20tools/liveinfo/


DuinoBoX-v0.5.5-x86:
-----------------------
https://github.com/ExtraordinaryBen/DuinoBoX
Be sure to upload the duinobox-sketch.ino to the Arduino*

\DuinoBoX-v0.5.5-x86\DuinoBoX-v0.5.5-x86\duinobox-sketch\duinobox-sketch.ino 

Chimp Loader:
--------------------
https://github.com/Rocky5/Chimp261812

A hard drive utility program for cloning/creating new drives for the original xbox
it is also able to lock and unlock drives 

Found on most xbox utility cd/dvd iso's that are available.
(Rocky 5, TrueHexen, Slayers, AIO)

*May be able to get XboxHdm to work with an ide capable computer and the new eeprom*

Eeprom | HDD Key Backup 
=======================================
Connect to the lpc header the second row from the top 
(top being ide connector side) are the points
needed SDA and SCL. Ground is on the bottom row on the left pin.

Soldering in a pin header is useful

Open DuinoBoX.exe and select the COM port for the Arduino 

Next turn on the Xbox and click Read this process is a bit finicky and may take a few tries
to get a successful read. After it reads the data click File>Save EEPROM.Bin

*It took a few times of reconnecting and restarting the console to get a working file. 
Reset and upload the sketch to the Arduino again may also help. If having trouble further try
powering on the console while clicking read inside DuinoBox at the same time. 

Keep this file safe.

The file Will most likely be a 256 bytes possibly 512/1mb

From here take the EEPROM.bin file and open it with LiveInfo.

If the read was successful it will load the motherboard revision, serial number hard drive 
and other info stored inside the eeprom.

*Do note that live info sometimes generates new info when opened as it can be used to create new/spoofed eeprom images*
*Be sure to check the serial number is correct when opening the eeprom otherwise the hdd key may be incorrect*

From here we can use the HDD Key to lock the drive via Chimp Loader on the modified Xbox

Locking/Unlocking Hard drives via Chimp Loader
=====================================================

Take the top shell from the modified xbox off and turn the console on let it boot into alternate dashboard (UnleashX/Evo/Avalaunch)
/utility disc (Rocky 5, TrueHexen, Slayers AIO) disconnect the dvd drive ide cable and connect it to the hard drive you 
are using to lock or clone the original drive. Also connect the molex power adapter to the hard drive. 

After navigate and launch Chimp Loader it will greet you with a few prompts until the program starts.

A hard drive icon will appear press A once the new drive is connected via the ide cable from the disc drive along with 
external molex power adapter. Set the jumper to slave.

After Chimp loader finishes loading the linux distro press A 

*This prompt will give ftp/ip info for transferring eeprom via ethernet if connected.*

user:root
pass:xbox

--------------------------------------------------
Scan the drives connected using the first option

Next go to #4 TSOP/Chipped Xbox confirm yes twice 

Then option #5 Other Options > #4 Advanced Features say yes to the locking/unlocking prompts

Next to lock the drive click "Lock Drive"

Depending if the console is stock you are preparing the drive for
you will need to transfer the eeprom created from the DuinoBox read 
to the /tmp/eeprom.bin via the an ftp connection.

Then select lock from /tmp/eeprom.bin

If the console you are using is where your installing the drive select lock from motherboard

*Consoles that are tsop or modchipped don't require a drive to be locked*

From here you can clone the original/master drive to the slave/new(locked) drive via option #2
there are a few options for partitions and stuff most of the defaults should be fine.

Scan the ide devices again to make sure the new/slave drive locked after it completed cloning. 

Reinstall the ide cable into the disc drive and replace the hardrive in the caddy with the new locked drive. 

Once everythings connected if it all went well it should startup into the dashboard. 

*If you recieve an error 5/6 its possible the hard drive key is not correctly set and may need to try relocking the drive.
Make sure the hard drives jumper is set to master if it still doesn't start to the dashboard*

Well I was able to revive the console that otherwise had no power initially. The console ate the raspberry pi i was trying
to read the eeprom with but was able to get a good read from the arduino. Console seems to be working fine otherwise will have
to tinker with the sticky dvd drive but the components look fine for now so hopefully it stays working for a bit.
